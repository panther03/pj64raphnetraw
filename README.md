# pj64 input plugin with direct N64 controller access for raphnet adapters

This input plugin for project64 uses the direct controller access feature offered by raphnet N64 to USB
adapters (versions 3 and up) to let the emulated game communicate with the controllers directly.

* Perfect accuracy: The controller works exactly as it would on a N64 system, without any calibration or tweaking.
* Rumble Pak and Controller Pak (mempak) support (and potentially other accesories too [not confirmed])
* Support for other peripherals that connect to controller ports (eg: N64 mouse) [not confirmed]
* Low latency

DLL files to "Project64 installation directory"/Plugin/Input:

* pj64raphnetraw.dll
* libhidapi-0.dll

## Building the plugin

The plugin is compiled using mingw-w64 under Linux.

### System requirements

A Linux system such as Debian with the following packages installed: (non-exhaustive list)

* mingw-w64
* autotools-dev
* autoconf
* automake
* libtool
* git
* make

### Environment

#### Directory layout

An HIDAPI build is expected in ../hidapi. i.e. The following directory structure is required:

* ...somedir/pj64raphnetraw
* ...somedir/hidapi

#### preparing the hidapi build

The plugin makefile assumes the following:

* An hidapi configured and compiled with --host i686-w64-mingw32 found in ../hidapi

hidapi can be obtained like this:

```sh
$ cd ...somedir
$ git clone https://github.com/signal11/hidapi.git
```

And then to compile it:
```sh
cd ...somedir/hidapi
./bootstrap
./configure --host i686-w64-mingw32
make
```

#### Compilation

This would cross-compile the 32 and 64-bit windows versions.

```bash
$ cd .../somedir/
$ cd pj64raphnetraw/src
$ make
```
