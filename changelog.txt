2016-04-16: Version 1.0.3
	- Fix ports 1 and 3 special version
	- Another attempt to fix netplay (version 1.0.2 did not work)

2017-04-10: Version 1.0.2
	- Add a single-port version (improves dual-port adapter performance
	  in some situations by not attempting to poll non-connected controllers)
	- Add a netplay version. (Single player only. Hopefully this one will work
	  with the newest firmware)

2017-02-04: Version 1.0.1
	- Add a ports 1 and 3 build (for the Densha de GO! controller)

2017-01-15: Version 1.0.0
    - Add multiple adapter support
	- Add a special build where adapter port 2 equals N64 port 4 (for VRU)

2016-12-03: Version 0.9.4
	- Improved structure and separation for easier maintenance of the code
	  shared between the Project 64 and mupen64plus versions of this plugin.
	- Support for the upcoming 3.4.x adapter firmware (will provide even lower
	latency/overhead)

2016-11-26: Version 0.9.3
	- Only handle channels supported by the adapter. This increases
	  performance (reduces lag) by preventing meaningless attempts to
	  communicate with controllers connected to non-existing ports on the
	  adapter. It also fixes issues where games would see more than one
	  controller was present.

2016-11-24: Version 0.9.2
	- Protect against invalid commands received from emulator. This fixes
	  some games that failed to start with a "Break point found" message.

2016-11-23: Version 0.9.1
	- Use controller plugin spec 1.0 instead of 1.1 for compatibility with
	  older version of Project 64.
	- Disable controller polling only when a ROM is open.

2016-11-22: Version 0.9
	- Initial release
